# GitHub Copilot Problem Statement

The combination of Artificial Intelligence and cloud computing is taking the world by storm. To match up the fast pace requirements of the industry, new tools are emerging for the ease of development and understanding. Microsoft understands the needs of the hour and have developed Github Copilot. With the help of the Github Copilot, the developers can speedup their work with more accuracy and correctness and more available alternatives.

The hackathon is primarily focused on testing out the candidates on different themes leveraging the usage of the Github Copilot. There are five themes provided below and the candidates can choose to work on any of them. The preferred languages are mentioned along with the themes but the candidates are free to use the language of their choice: Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, .NET(C#)

## Weather Forecasting Tool (Python)

Create a command-line tool that accepts a city's name and returns the current weather forecast. Leverage OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and parse it using Python. Your solution should demonstrate how GitHub Copilot can help you with API usage, data parsing, and error handling.

This was the problem statement given to us by Microsoft to build and we were given 2 months to build this.
