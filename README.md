# GitHub Copilot Problem Statement

The combination of Artificial Intelligence and cloud computing is taking the world by storm. To match up the fast pace requirements of the industry, new tools are emerging for the ease of development and understanding. Microsoft understands the needs of the hour and have developed Github Copilot. With the help of the Github Copilot, the developers can speedup their work with more accuracy and correctness and more available alternatives.

You can refer the below links to know more about Github Copilot:

- [Github Copilot Blog](https://github.blog/2023-03-22-github-copilot-x-the-ai-powered-developer-experience/)

The hackathon is primarily focused on testing out the candidates on different themes leveraging the usage of the Github Copilot. There are five themes provided below and the candidates can choose to work on any of them. The preferred languages are mentioned along with the themes but the candidates are free to use the language of their choice: Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, .NET(C#)

## Weather Forecasting Tool (Python)

Create a command-line tool that accepts a city's name and returns the current weather forecast. Leverage OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and parse it using Python. Your solution should demonstrate how GitHub Copilot can help you with API usage, data parsing, and error handling.

## Deliverables

- Presentation: It should should consist of the Business Challenge /Use Cases + Proposed Solution + High level architecture + Mention of usage of Github Copilot [(Click here to download sample PPT)](https://www.techgig.com/files/contest_upload_files/CG23-Github_Copilot_U_Hackathon.pptx)
- Include supporting diagrams, screenshots, if any

## Idea/Selection Criteria for the Jury

- Teams/Individual can submit one or more ideas
- Ideas must align with one or more hackathon themes
- Technical alignment with Microsoft Cloud Technologies and Github Copilot
- A real feasible idea that can get translated to a prototype real quick
- All artifacts including Presentation + Proposed Solution + Usage of Github Copilot +High level architecture, supporting diagrams etc. must be complete in the ideation template

## Prototyping

- An appropriate name for the solution
- Solution must be a working prototype supported by slides with a full blown architecture
- Solution must be based on Github Copilot and clearly state how it is used in the solution
- Innovation Quotient
- Must have a clear roadmap and not an experimental solution
- Demonstration video of the solution explaining the working and key aspects of the solution.

## Jury criteria

- Completeness
- Correctness & Performance
- Usage of the Github Copilot and Microsoft related technologies
- Innovation and Design

This was the problem statement given to us by Microsoft to build and we were given 2 months to build this.

We are going to use the free API given by [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) organisation to build this project
